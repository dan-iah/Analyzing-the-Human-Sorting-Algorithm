# Analyzing-the-Human-Sorting-Algorithm

While studies have been conducted to analyze various human cognitive abilities, an uninvestigated area is the inherent human ability to organize information in sequential order: sorting. Considering the heavy reliance on sorting algorithms in Computer Science, this study explores human sorting behavior, and how it differs from the patterns of established sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort. For the humans and algorithms, we observe how sorting quality improves as the number of sorting moves increases during a task, the number of sorting moves performed until a certain item is first moved, the number of sorting moves until an item reaches its correct position in the sorting list, and the frequency of move distances taken by participants during a task.
